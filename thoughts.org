So much dataaaaaaa.

First of all, I'd like a good knowledge of /where/ is it that the system fails. Which parts does it miss out. I have noticed some interesting differences between the extracted and the gold datasets; I would like to see what linguistic context they fall in.

Hey, I'm a linguist. I'm all about studying linguistic contexts.

This would require some code, because- dude, where the fuck is the actual novels ka corpus?
