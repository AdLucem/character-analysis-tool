* What is wrong with NER-based approaches
* Detecting Characters

An *8-stage* pipeline is propopsed for detecting characters.

This pipeline builds a graph where nodes are names and edges connect names belonging to the same character.

# what does the thing do? what model does it use?

  - The F1 scores for corefence resolution are themselves low. Unless we want to work on a coref system... better ways of getting coreferences 

* Problems In Implementing This

  - Where the fuck are the rules (for the rule-based stages) and the gazzetteers?

* Observations and Notes

  - Our proposed 'alternate' system for resolving aliases *is* social network system
  - Will anything be gained by dependency parsing the data as a form of preprocessing?
  - play around with coreference resolution system?
