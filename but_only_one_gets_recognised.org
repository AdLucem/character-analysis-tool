* What is wrong with NER-based approaches
* Detecting Characters

An *8-stage* pipeline is propopsed for detecting characters.

This pipeline builds a graph where nodes are names and edges connect names belonging to the same character.

(1) The vertices in the graph are initially populated by:
      - Running NER over the corpus
      - Identifying names that follow a honorific (list of honorifics maintained?)
